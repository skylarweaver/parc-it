# Parc-It!

Anonymous office request board for the 0xPARC office, inspired by the [double-blind project](https://github.com/dgulotta/double-blind).

---

## Background and Motivation

Parc-It! is an anonymous office request board for the 0xPARC office. The goal is to allow members of a specific group (e.g., the 0xPARC GitHub org) to submit office requests anonymously, with cryptographic proof that the request comes from a group member, but without revealing which member. The app features a retro 1990s web interface and is built with Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Supabase, and custom cryptography (Plonky2, WASM).

**Key Features:**
- Anonymous request submission and upvoting
- Admin-managed group membership (via GitHub SSH keys)
- Retro Windows 95-style UI
- Cryptographic group signatures (Plonky2, WASM)
- Extensible for comments, multi-group support, and more

## Privacy-Preserving Login & Authentication

### Motivation
Parc-It! is designed to maximize privacy for group members. The goal is to allow users to prove group membership and submit requests **without revealing their identity** to the server or other users, unless they explicitly choose to doxx themselves. We avoid traditional authentication (OAuth, passwords, cookies) and instead use cryptographic group signatures and a hashed key system.

### How It Works
- **Double Blind Key (DBK):**
  - Each user generates a unique SSH signature (the "Double Blind Key") using their private SSH key.
  - This DBK is never sent to the server in plaintext.
- **Hashed Key System:**
  - On signup, the client hashes the DBK using SHA-256 and sends only the hash to the server.
  - The server stores only the hash, never the raw DBK.
  - On login, the client fetches the list of all valid DBK hashes from the server and checks locally if their hash is present. **The DBK or its hash is never sent to the server during login.**
  - If the hash is present, the user is allowed to log in; otherwise, they must sign up.
- **Group Signature Proofs:**
  - When submitting a new idea/request, the user generates a group signature proof using their DBK and the group's public keys.
  - The server verifies the proof, confirming the request comes from a group member, but cannot tell which member.
  - No additional authentication is required for submitting requestsâ€”**the group signature proof is the only requirement.**
- **Admin Actions:**
  - Admins are a subset of group members, identified by their public key.
  - Admin actions (add/remove member, delete request) require both a valid DBK hash and admin status.

### Privacy Model
- **No server-side login sessions or cookies.**
- **No OAuth, passwords, or email addresses.**
- **No DBK or public key is sent to the server during login.**
- **All group membership checks are done client-side using the hash list.**
- **Only the group signature proof is required for submitting requests.**
- **Admins are verified by public key, but all admin actions are still privacy-preserving for regular requests.**

### User Flow (Updated)
- **Login:**
  1. User pastes their Double Blind Key (SSH signature).
  2. The app hashes the key and checks it against the list of valid hashes fetched from the server.
  3. If present, the user is logged in locally (no info sent to server).
  4. If not present, the user is prompted to sign up (hash sent to server once).
- **Signup:**
  1. User pastes their GitHub username and Double Blind Key.
  2. The app hashes the key and sends the hash and username to the server.
  3. The server stores the hash and associates it with the user.
- **Submit Request:**
  1. User generates a group signature proof using their DBK and the group's public keys.
  2. The proof is sent to the server with the request.
  3. The server verifies the proof and records the request if valid.
- **Admin Actions:**
  1. Admins log in with their DBK as above.
  2. Admin actions require both a valid DBK hash and admin status (checked server-side).

## User Flows

- **Public:** View requests, group members, and technical details. Cannot submit or upvote.
- **Login:** Paste "Double Blind Key" to derive public key and check membership.
- **Authenticated:** Submit requests, upvote, view all features.
- **Admin:** Manage group members, delete requests, see admin-only UI.

---

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, custom components.
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Edge Functions), RESTful endpoints, scheduled jobs for key fetching (manual or via API route).
- **Cryptography:** Plonky2 circuits (WASM), group signatures, nullifiers for upvoting.
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `/api/github-keys`: Fetches public SSH keys for a GitHub username (server-side, CORS-safe).
  - `/api/upvote`: Verifies group signature, extracts nullifier, and records upvote if not duplicate.

---

## Data Model (Supabase Schema)

- **office_requests:** Stores requests, signatures, group info, and metadata.
- **group_members:** GitHub username, avatar, public key, admin status.
- **admins:** Admin public keys and GitHub usernames.
- **request_upvotes:** (Upvoting) request_id, nullifier, timestamp, unique constraint.
- **(Future) comments:** Anonymous comments on requests.

See [`docs/schema.sql`](docs/schema.sql) for full schema.

### WASM Setup: Plonky2 Group Signature Circuits

This project uses custom cryptographic group signature circuits, compiled to WebAssembly (WASM), originally developed by [Daniel Gulotta (dgulotta)](https://github.com/dgulotta) for the [double-blind project](https://github.com/dgulotta/double-blind). **Big thanks to Daniel for his work on the Plonky2 RSA circuits!**

#### How to Obtain the WASM Files

You will need the following files from a build of the `double-blind-web` package (from the double-blind repo or your own build):
- `double_blind_web_bg.wasm`
- `double_blind_web.js`
- `double_blind_web.d.ts` (optional, for TypeScript projects)

##### If you have a directory like `double-blind/double-blind-web/pkg/`:

1. **Locate the Files:**
   - Go to the `pkg/` directory inside your build output, e.g.:
     ```
     double-blind/double-blind-web/pkg/
     ```
   - You should see files like:
     - `double_blind_web_bg.wasm`
     - `double_blind_web.js`
     - `double_blind_web.d.ts`

2. **Copy to Your Project:**
   - Copy `double_blind_web_bg.wasm` to your app's public WASM directory:
     ```
     cp double-blind/double-blind-web/pkg/double_blind_web_bg.wasm parc-it/public/wasm/
     ```
   - Copy `double_blind_web.js` and (optionally) `double_blind_web.d.ts` to your helpers directory:
     ```
     cp double-blind/double-blind-web/pkg/double_blind_web.js parc-it/src/helpers/plonky2/
     cp double-blind/double-blind-web/pkg/double_blind_web.d.ts parc-it/src/helpers/plonky2/
     ```

3. **Reference in Your Code:**
   - The app is set up to load the WASM file from `/public/wasm/double_blind_web_bg.wasm` and import the JS glue code from `src/helpers/plonky2/double_blind_web.js`.

##### If you need to build from source:

1. **Clone the double-blind repo:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dgulotta/double-blind.git
   cd double-blind/double-blind-web
   ```
2. **Install Rust and WASM build tools:**
   ```sh
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli
   ```
3. **Build the WASM package:**
   ```sh
   cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
   wasm-bindgen ../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/double_blind_web.wasm --out-dir pkg --target web
   ```
4. **Copy the output files as described above.**

- See the [double-blind README](https://github.com/dgulotta/double-blind) for more details on building the WASM package.
- The WASM and JS files are required for cryptographic group signature operations in the app.

## Lessons and Best Practices

- Use docs folder for documentation.
- Desktop-first, always-on retro theme.
- **No OAuth or passwords; login via Double Blind Key only.**
- **No server-side login sessions; all group membership checks are client-side and privacy-preserving.**
- **No DBK or public key is sent to the server during login.**
- Admins identified by hardcoded SSH pub keys.
- Fetch only first RSA key from GitHub .keys every 10 minutes.
- Avoid large fields in list queries; fetch only what is needed.
- Watch for duplicate fetches in React apps.

---

## Future Work

- Integrate full Plonky2 cryptography for group signatures.
- Add comments, multi-group support, and more admin features.
- Improve performance and scalability.
- Expand documentation and add more tests.
